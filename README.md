# GIRAF-3d-CG
GIRAF algorithm for MRI data in 3 dimension using the CG iterative algorithm, that means the algorithm is relatively slow.

the codes of this method is just a extension of [the original 2d GIRAF algorithm](https://github.com/cbig-iowa/giraf) from [Greg Ongie](https://github.com/gregongie)

because of the 3d properties, it is difficult to using the same solution of the original optimazation problem. if we stick to using the same solution, it must import the CG itaritive algorithm that makes the codes run slowly. 

the derivation of formulas will be upload as soon as possible.

for now, it is an early version, because the annotation of the codes is not so well and is mixed with English and Chinese. it will be correct in a short time.

although there are few deficiencies, it is easily to run the codes correctly. try it and test it!

perfect it together!
